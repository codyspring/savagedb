# SavageDB
In memory datastore with flat file persistence.

## NOTE
SavageDB is not being built for extremely high levels of performance (hundreds of thousands of
documents) or extremely high write throughput. We're not opposed to those use cases or pull requests
for such things but, won't be building that into it on our own.
